## What's in this Repository
1. The STERGM_fit.R file takes as input the temporal data of node attributes and edge connections in the bipartite network. It fits a Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (ST-ERGM) using the temporal snapshots of the bipartite network. As features, it takes into account the 'alter' nodes' creative performance, and the homophily of race and gender between the 'egos' and 'alters'. Seperate models are fit for the link formation and dissolution patterns. Please see the manuscript for details.

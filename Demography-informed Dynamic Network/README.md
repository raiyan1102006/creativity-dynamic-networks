Baten RA, Ghoshal G, Hoque ME, Availability of demographic cues can negatively impact creativity in dynamic social networks, (submitted) [arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.05937](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05937.pdf), September 2020.


## What's in this Repository
1. The STERGM_fit.R file takes as input the temporal data of node attributes and edge connections in the bipartite network. It fits a Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (ST-ERGM) using the temporal snapshots of the bipartite network. As features, it takes into account the 'alter' nodes' creative performance, and the homophily of race and gender between the 'egos' and 'alters'. Seperate models are fit for the link formation and dissolution patterns. Please see the manuscript for details.

2. The rest of the codebase of the paper will be released upon acceptance.
